# Music Player

You are building a Music Player app.
You need to implement the MusicPlayer class, which should hold the track names as Strings in an array. The array is already defined in the given code.
The player should support the following functions:
**add:** add the given argument track to the tracks array.
**show:** output all track names in the player on separate lines.
**play:** start playing the first track by outputting "Playing name" where name is the first track name.

You can add a new item to an array using +=, for example: **tracks += track**
